class TSP_RL(nn.Module):
    """Defines the main Encoder, Decoder, and Pointer combinatorial models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    static_size: int
        Defines how many features are in the static elements of the model
        (e.g. 2 for (x, y) coordinates)
    dynamic_size: int > 1
        Defines how many features are in the dynamic elements of the model
        (e.g. 2 for the VRP which has (load, demand) attributes. The TSP doesn't
        have dynamic elements, but to ensure compatibility with other optimization
        problems, assume we just pass in a vector of zeros.
    hidden_size: int
        Defines the number of units in the hidden layer for all static, dynamic,
        and decoder output units.
    update_fn: callable or None
        If provided, this method is used to calculate how the input dynamic
        elements are updated, and is called after each 'point' to the input element.
        For example, for the VRP, this function can reduce the load and demand of
        the visited node by one unit.
    mask_fn: callable or None
        Allows us to specify which elements of the input sequence are allowed to
        be selected. This is useful for speeding up training of the networks,
        by providing a sort of 'rules' guidelines to the algorithm. If no mask
        is provided, we terminate the search after a fixed number of iterations
        to avoid tours that stretch forever.
        For example, for the VRP, this function can prevent pointing to nodes that
        have zero demand or exceed the vehicle capacity.
    num_layers: int
        Specifies the number of hidden layers to use in the decoder RNN
    dropout: float
        Defines the dropout rate for the decoder

        Parameters
        ----------
        static: Array of size (batch_size, num_feats, num_customers)
            Defines the elements to consider as static. For the TSP, this could be
            things like the (x, y) coordinates, which won't change
        dynamic: Array of size (batch_size, num_feats, num_customers)
            Defines the elements to consider as static. For the VRP, this can be
            things like the (load, demand) of each city. If there are no dynamic
            elements, this can be set to None
        decoder_input: Array of size (batch_size, static_size)
            Defines the outputs for the decoder. Currently, we just use the
            static elements (e.g. (x, y) coordinates), but this can technically
            be other things as well
